                Matilda was an ordinary schoolgirl, as normal as one could get, well-behaved, friendly, and chimed in
                occasionally in
                girl talk; after all, she lacked the grit to play otherwise. For her, the rush for running away peaked
                whenever her way
                of getting things sorted out by immersing herself in a make-believe calm state got trespassed. That is,
                when she was
                infuriated or saddened or disgusted by what was happening around her. The escape destination could be
                the States, where
                she was fascinated by Asian American girls’ natural charm and where the front garden trampoline, the
                kids’ park they’d
                go with the host-family kids who comforted her that “No one’s mean” in school, the semi-elliptical
                clearing where
                parents parked and picked up elementary school kids still lingered over her. Or it could be New Zealand,
                where she used
                to turn somersaults on the lawns. Anyhow, she never expected it to be Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matilda started vomiting when the plane heading for Brisbane flew over the equator. The cup of instant
                noodles she
                brought along to replace the airplane food would go into waste because nausea had preceded hunger unless
                she was to
                endure another long flight before it expired. Her last trip to Brisbane five years ago, also accompanied
                by overwhelming
                sickness, was a world different; at least she did not need to fumble around for her luggage with a
                fragile body alone.
                Which was better, solving endless solid geometry or suppressing the impulse to throw up in the cab (do
                Australians call
                it a cab?) that took her to an apartment on Barramul Street, she could not tell. Or to hell. And the
                hazardous image of
                her getting raped and murdered on a desert island kept coming back to her until the familiar crossroad
                and the Sports
                Park across Woolworths came into view.
            </p>
            <p>
                The late-coming relief took over her as she stood on the ground floor under the two-story flat. She
                pushed the luggage
                onto a slight slope that led to the elevator, pressed the button to the second floor, and realized that
                she had no keys.
                It was late into night, and it would be intruding to knock lest a grumpy roommate (if she ever has one)
                be interrupted.
                So she dialed the landlord, a retired man living not far away (so she assumed). A minute or two later,
                the door opened.
                A girl not much older than herself with fluffy hair dyed in light brown (Matilda hated the hair color),
                ardent, pinky
                lips, and swollen sleepy eyes. Korean? Or Chinese? Matilda murmured ‘thanks’ (the Sleepy Eye said she
                was Chim in turn),
                briefly introduced herself as the ‘other’ tenant, and slipped into the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of politeness, Matilda asked whether she’d like any of her salted porridge for breakfast. Amused,
                Chim asked if she
                was Chinese. Yes, Matilda said. But somehow, they did not converse in their mother language.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Haven’t had porridge for years.” She accepted Matilda’s offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, only on special occasions. I have a bad stomach.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “So...for college?” Chim was drinking her share.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Applying for one, yes. You?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Nothing. Wandering around, reading, trying on new clothes and makeup and stuff.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Matilda did not probe further. The nonchalance Chim displayed seemed to have undermined the toughness of
                Matilda’s
                decision, which made her feel stupid. She instinctively mocked at Chim’s ignorance, ignorance about what
                absurdity she
                had been through. Had Chim experienced her life, she would hesitate to say she lived to try on clothes.
                But then Matilda
                thought, she could wear fancy earrings and put on immature makeup now.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I will go for a walk now,” Matilda blurted out to Chim once she put the pots and bowls in the
                dish-washing machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matilda did not bother to take out a map. Hazy memories, like a missing goat coming out of the fog, grew
                clearer. Once
                out of the apartment building, she turned right and went up a hill where houses lined alongside the
                street. The street?
                Did it use to be a narrower path separated by trees, or did she get the direction wrong? Then a sudden
                stomach cramp
                attacked Matilda, reminding her that all she had in the past 20 hours were mouthfuls of insipid
                porridge. The pain was,
                without doubt, worsened by the scorching sun in the late morning and the effects of jet lag. Her drained
                body was
                yearning for the bed. Why was she here, halfway to the top of a slope? Her unresponsive brain hasn’t
                comprehended the
                whole fact that she was no longer in ‘that’ place where purpose was stuffed in every scribble and
                hurried stride. No one
                would ever dare invent the legitimacy to spy, eavesdrop, tattle, or secretly photograph. And no
                violators would be
                thrown into the abyss of guilt, shame, and horror. Matilda was not obliged to do anything, not even
                visit the past, and
                lying in bed all day was as natural as having cereal with milk for breakfast.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Matilda came back, Chim was reclining on the daybed in the roomy balcony, reading, basking in the
                sun. Matilda went
                straight into her room and figured she would stay up till noon and take a nap, to adjust.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matilda woke up to the clashes of pots and dishes at 5 pm. A sound sleep, no dreams. Dazed and thirsty.
                She grabbed a
                cup of water in the kitchen, where Chim was fiddling with carrots, fresh scallions, andouille, and
                pasta.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Did I wake you?” Chim cut the carrots into small pieces and put them into the boiling water, in which
                the pasta was
                softening.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No, no. It’s about time.” The cold water Matilda swallowed sent a shudder through her.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So...how is it here?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Matilda could utter a word, Chim said, more to herself, wryly, “God, can’t believe I asked such a
                stupid
                question.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Quite the same as I’d expected. I was too weak to look around anyway.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s the kind of place that seeps into you. You can’t say it’s love or anything.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’ve been here for long?” Matilda regretted the way she asked Chim. It sounded as if she were
                questioning her
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chim didn’t seem to mind, “A while. I move a lot. To try new stuff.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “There were things I couldn’t stand, so...” Matilda was working her language carefully. She wanted Chim
                to get a glimpse
                of things but did not want her to think she was making a big deal out of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Sure there were.” Chim nodded light-heartedly, taking it as a natural fact, then removed the cooked
                pasta to a
                colander.
            </p>
            <p>
                “By the way, I will leave for the South Island in a couple of days.” She added.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The one in New Zealand?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She acknowledged it and added oil to the heated pan.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you staying?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Guess not. Can’t say for sure. I will keep renting here though. You’ve been there?”
            </p>
            <p>
                So she had no plans, Matilda thought. “Yeah, when I was thirteen.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What do you recall?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I bought a plush sheep for fifteen dollars and there was a once-in-a-year sheep parade that day.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Chim laughed, “Fair enough.”
            </p>
            <p>
                They were silent for a moment when Chim was adding garlic and bolognese sauce to the pasta.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If you hear me cry or scream at night, just ignore it and don’t panic. These things happen; sorry if I
                disturb you.”
                The tone was less careless.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What?” At first, Matilda did not grasp it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You never know.” Chim turned off the heat and stared right into Matilda’s bewildered eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Would you like some?” Chim was referring to the noodles.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’d love to.”
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>
                “En Creux: The Audiovisual Objects” is a sound visualization project based on the application of a piano
                and
                TouchDesigner, a node-based visual programming language for interactive multimedia content. “En_creux”
                (English:
                hollowed out), the French neologism I use to descriptively capture the core of this project, was
                originally coined by
                French music theorist Michel Chion. According to Chion, the attempt “to create a purposeful and fruitful
                tension between
                what is on screen and what is kindled in the mind of the audience” creates an in-between tension, which
                he terms
                “en creux”. [ Michel Chion, Audio-vision: sound on screen. Columbia University Press, (2019): xix.] In
                this project, I
                create audio-reactive geometric shapes based on several clips of Ludwig Van Beethoven’s world-class
                sonatas Moonlight
                and Pathétique. The en creux aspect precisely lies in the insurmountable gap between what is presented
                on the screen by
                TouchDesigner and audiences’ imagination. Beethoven’s Moonlight and Pathétique are chosen as major sound
                sources for
                their unprecedentedly high-contrast rhythms. The highly energetic pieces could easily be visualized and
                audiences could
                easily feel the changing flow of sound.

            <h4>Theoretical Framing</h4>
            <p>
                The idea of rendering new media art that combines visual art and sound originally derives from Michel
                Chion’s concept of
                “synchresis”. Along with the concept of “the audiovisual contract”, “synchresis” suggests “the forging
                of an immediate
                and necessary relationship between something one sees and something one hears at the same time”.[ Chion,
                Audio-vision:
                sound on screen. Columbia University Press, (2019): 224.] In other words, sound and visual arts form a
                whole instead of
                “added” supplements to one another, creating the audiovisual objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Added value” is a concept Michel Chion further proposes to theorize the complex relationship of sound
                and
                image. He
                defined it as “the expressive and informative value with which a sound enriches a given image so as to
                create the
                definitive impression”.[ Ibid, 5.] In short, added value naturalizes the combination of sound and image
                and
                facilitates
                the reciprocal interaction of the two entities. Sound and images convey drastically different meanings
                and
                feelings when
                appear independently and ensemble.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the concept of “intermedia characteristics” proposed by Föllmer et al. is enlightening.[
                Föllmer et al,
                Audiovisions. Music as an Intermedia Art Form, 1931, quoted in Nuno Correia, Intermedia audiovisual
                objects,
                School of
                Arts, Design and Architecture, (2013): 58.] The theory is highly correlated with what new media artist
                Nuno
                Correia
                called the “inherent multi-sensoriality in music”, which indicates that the encounter and confrontation
                of
                different
                media are embedded in music.[ Ibid, 58.] Similarly, Föllmer et al. highlight the fact that music is
                inscribed in the
                visual environment, whether through “special production and reception conditions” or “graphic symbols
                and
                visually
                influenced forms of interaction”.[ Ibid, 58.] The notion of interaction, especially that of the visual
                and
                the audio, is
                key to the theory.

            <h4>About TouchDesigner</h4>
            <p>
                As a node-based visual programming language, TouchDesigner enables multiple built-in functions, with
                which
                multimedia
                works can be realized. Nodes and operators, which refer to the fundamental visual blocks, are pieces of
                software that
                take inputs and produce outputs. Divided into six categories, operators from the same block family can
                be
                connected to
                generate outputs. To view the final work in motion, users can select “Perform Mode”, in which the
                default
                background
                color is black.[ Markku Laskujärvi, “Real-time interactive animated visualisations for music
                performances:
                comparing
                Blender game engine and TouchDesigner,” (2018): 14-18.] In “En Creux: The Audiovisual Objects”, the CHOP
                and
                TOP
                families are commonly used to be merged into pipelines that ultimately enable the rendered geometries to
                respond to
                sounds.
            </p>
            <h4>Tangible Crystal, Scattered Dots, and Musical Strings</h4>
            <p>
                The project is composed of “tangible crystal”, “scattered dots”, and “musical strings”, which
                respectively
                refer to the
                basic geometries of a 3D sphere, 2D circles, and straight lines. As a novice in TouchDesigner, I could
                not
                foresee the
                ultimate changing pattern of the shapes as I render the geometries, adding a sense of spontaneity to the
                works. CHOPs,
                TOPs, and other components are commonly used to input audio and shapes. I recorded the transfiguration
                of
                the geometries
                that are reactive to the Beethoven sonatas in the TouchDesigner performance mode. On the website, the
                works
                are
                displayed in the form of videos with background music.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                “En_Creux: The Audiovisual Objects” is an experimental project that aims to renew listener-viewers’
                audiovisual
                experiences. TouchDesigner enables the combination of visual arts and music, achieving “synchresis”
                and
                presenting the
                “added value” of the two realms. The ultimate success of the combination is open to the audiences’
                judge. In
                the first
                place, classical music composed by Beethoven could bring confusion to any untrained ear in the
                professional
                area.
                Visualizing sonatas in a geometrical way, this audiovisual project can be seen as an attempt to
                reduce
                audiences’
                distance from the “grandiose” classics.

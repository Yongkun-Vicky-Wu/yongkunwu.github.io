        <div class="main-content">
            <p>During the period of modernization and development in Europe (16th-19th centuries), human anatomy was
                gradually
                introduced to the public and to artists as medicine advanced. At a time when people were curious about
                the structure of
                the human body, an entertainment and teaching venue called the "anatomical theater" was opened to the
                public for viewing
                and learning. As performers in the theater, anatomists demonstrated the process of dissecting a corpse
                (autopsy),
                usually that of a criminal. Death, sin, and mystery are the elements of this grand spectacle that
                stimulates the senses
                of the audience to the maximum. Indeed, medicine not only occupied a unique position in the field of
                popular
                entertainment but also attracted the attention of artists. As one of the early masterpieces in the quest
                to combine art
                and medicine, Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man presents the human body in a highly aesthetic male nude.
                To this day,
                the popular exhibition of the human body still attracts the fearful and curious eyes of the public, and
                the female body
                is the focus of the anatomical spectacle. Medical anatomy as an artistic content and form has never lost
                its charm, and
                it is the contemporary Japanese artist Eimi Suzuki who combines anatomy, the female body, and various
                shadowy elements
                to create art that is retro, dark, and elegant. For Suzuki, medicine is "rooted in the life of the
                public" and helps her
                to construct her own vision.</p>
            <p>在欧洲现代化萌芽与发展的时期（16-19世纪），随着医学的进步，人体解剖学逐渐走进大众与艺术家的视野。在人们对人体结构抱有好奇心的年代，一种名为“解剖剧院”的娱乐与教学场所向公众开放，用以观赏及学习。作为剧场的表演者，解剖师展示尸体（通常是罪犯）剖检的过程。死亡、罪恶、与神秘感构成了这场盛大奇观的要素，最大限度地刺激观众的感官。事实上，医学不仅在大众娱乐领域占据着独特的地位，而且也吸引了艺术家的注意力。作为早期寻求艺术与医学结合的代表作之一，列昂纳多·达芬奇的作品《维特鲁威人》（Vitruvian
                Man）以极具美感的男性裸体展现了人体的魅力。至今，风靡全球的人体展览仍然吸引大众恐惧而好奇的目光，女性的身体更是解剖奇观的焦点。医学解剖作为一种艺术内容与形式从未失去其魅力，当代日本艺术家Eimi
                Suzuki正是将解剖、女体、及各种阴暗元素相结合，创造出集复古、黑暗、和优雅于一身的艺术。对于Suzuki而言，医学“就在大众身边扎根于生活”，可以帮助她构建自己心中的视觉效果。</p>
            <p>Suzuki's work is progressive rather than nostalgic and backward and is highly recognized in the field of
                art and
                fashion. Her focus on the theme of women and the human body and the way she presents them have endeared
                her to clothing
                brands such as Juliette et Justine and Pays des fées. By collaborating with the fashion industry, Suzuki
                transforms the
                stories she tells about women in her paintings into a magnificent and elegant visual feast that allows
                the viewer to
                visualize their vintage fashion sense and the weight of history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki的作品是先进的，而非怀旧、落后的，它们在艺术与时尚的领域受到高度认可。她关注的女性与人体主题以及呈现的方式使她得到诸如Juliette et Justine和pays des
                fées等服装品牌的青睐。通过与时尚界合作，Suzuki将她在画作上讲述的关于女性的故事转化为瑰丽而高雅的视觉盛宴呈现出来，使观众得以直观地感受到其复古的时尚感和历史的厚重感。

                Eimi Suzuki (b. 1993) is a Japanese contemporary multimedia artist and jewelry designer. She graduated
                from Tokyo Bunka
                University in 2016 with a degree in Jewelry Metal Works and has since worked in multiple media,
                including
                two-dimensional painting, metalwork, and collages. In recent years, Suzuki has held group and solo
                exhibitions in art
                museums in Japan and around the world, including Kiyoshi Art Space (Tokyo), Galerie Daidou (France), and
                Galerie Vanilla
                (Ginza), among others. She also collaborated with several fashion brands, including Juliette et Justine,
                pays des fées,
                Kidill, imasa, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eimi
                Suzuki（生于1993年）是日本当代多媒体艺术家与珠宝设计师。她于2016年毕业于东京文华学园大学的珠宝金属专业，之后以二维画，金属品，与拼接等多媒介的方式进行创作。近年来，Suzuki在日本及世界各地的美术馆举办过群展和个展，其中包括清艺术空间（东京），大端画廊（法国），香草画廊（银座）等。2022年夏天，Suzuki创立了自己独立的珠宝品牌——eimiess。同时，她也和多个时尚品牌合作，包括Juliette
                et Justine，pays des fées，Kidill, imasa等。
            </p>
            <p>Suzuki's work is a fusion of ergonomics, classical Eastern and Western aesthetics, and feminism, with a
                novel, gorgeous,
                and somber character. The lace, bows, skeletons, and anatomical bodies used in her work form a visual
                spectacle that
                creates a dark and healing sensation. As a viewer, I was initially uncomfortable viewing Suzuki's
                paintings, but
                magically, this feeling turned into an overwhelming fascination over time, allowing me to briefly escape
                the anxiety of
                reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki的作品融合了人体医学，古典东西美学，与女权主义的特点，兼具新奇、华丽、与阴郁的特点。其作品中运用的蕾丝、蝴蝶结、骷髅、与解剖体等元素构成视觉的奇观，形成黑暗又治愈的观感。作为观众，我最初观看Suzuki画作是不适的，神奇的是，这种感觉会随着时间的推移转化为无法自拔的迷恋，使我得以短暂地逃离现实的焦虑与不安。
            </p>
            <h4>Suzuki的画作《Ballerinas》：医学骷髅头骨与芭蕾女舞者的故事
                <br>Suzuki’s Artwork, Ballerinas: The Medical Skull and the Story of Ballerinas
            </h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ballerinas is a work that shows Eimi Suzuki art's gloomy temperament and her concern for the state of
                women's existence.
                The overall pastel tone of the painting contrasts with the slave-like life of the 18th-century ballet
                dancers,
                highlighting the brutality of female beauty. The slender ballerinas in the painting dance in different
                poses, as if they
                were pieces of unbearable butterfly wings, like fragments on the skulls of grim-faced skeletons.
                Ingeniously, the legs
                of the five dancers act as the skull's teeth, which look flat from a distance, but are horrifyingly
                delicate when viewed
                up close. Lifting legs, sitting, jumping, and spinning, the ballet girls' lives do not blossom in the
                rhythm of their
                bodies but are imprisoned by the mechanical repetition of movements that restrict their bodies and the
                possibility of
                escape.
            </p>
            <p>
                《Ballerinas》是一件展现了Eimi
                Suzuki艺术阴郁气质和对女性生存状态的关怀的作品。画作整体的粉色调与其呈现的18世纪芭蕾女舞者奴隶般的生活构成鲜明的反差，突出了女性美丽的残酷性。画中体型纤细的芭蕾演员以不同的姿势舞蹈，她们仿佛一片片不堪一击的蝴蝶翅膀，如碎片般贴在面目狰狞的骷髅头骨上。巧妙的是，五名舞者的腿充当骷髅的牙齿，远看平平无奇，近看却细腻得恐怖。抬腿、端坐、跳跃、旋转，芭蕾女孩儿的人生并非在身体的律动中绽放，而是被一个个机械重复的动作禁锢了身体和出逃的可能性。
            </p>
            <p>
                Ballerinas's unique combination of elements - the skull and the ballet girl - is engraved in the
                audience's mind.
                Suzuki's horrific skull is a metaphor for the unbearable influence of the bourgeois patrons
                (male-dominated) on the
                dancers' lives that caused them irreversible damage. Ballet dancers in 18th century Europe were seen as
                vulgar and
                inferior, manipulated by the so-called "high society" capitalists as if their bodies were tireless and
                could be used
                indefinitely. With Ballerinas, Suzuki alludes to the beautiful and brutal ballet culture that the
                Impressionist painter
                Edgar Degas focused on, and tells the story of the historical injustice suffered by women in a way that
                reinterprets the
                story of the ballet girl and rebels against patriarchal power. After all, what could be a more
                pleasantly
                anti-patriarchal practice than portraying lithe, beautiful ballet girls dancing on the skulls of
                history?
            </p>
            <p>
                《Ballerinas》以其别具一格的要素组合方式——骷髅头盖骨与芭蕾女孩——在观众脑海中刻下了深深的烙印。Suzuki以恐怖的头骨隐喻当时资产阶级赞助人（男性主导）对舞者生命造成的不可逆转的伤害和身体的奴役。芭蕾舞者在18世纪的欧洲被视作粗俗的下等人，被所谓“上流社会”的资本家操控，仿佛她们的身体不知疲倦，可以被无限利用。女性芭蕾演员是供男性导演、观众娱乐的消耗品，可以随时被替代，她们的舞蹈生涯是短暂的、痛苦的。Suzuki借《Ballerinas》影射印象派画家埃德加·德加曾关注的美丽又残酷的芭蕾文化，以一种重新阐述芭蕾女孩故事，反抗父权的方式讲述着女性在历史上遭受过的不公。毕竟，有什么是比刻画轻盈美丽的芭蕾女孩在历史的头盖骨上跳舞更加痛快的反父权实践呢？

            <h4>Suzuki ✖ Juliette et Justine: Mangeurs de beauté/Beauty Eaters
                <br>Suzuki ✖ Juliette et Justine: 《食美者》
            </h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki's Mangeurs de beauté (translated as Beauty Eaters) series with Japanese clothing brand Juliette
                et Justine
                perfectly incorporates her classical, elegant art into its lolita clothing, making it sweet without
                losing its
                historical depth. At the same time, Suzuki's knack for using lighter tones adds a touch of feminine
                lightness to the
                gothic quality of the clothes, creating a sense of immersive pleasure. This outfit is taken from
                Suzuki's work "Epicure
                Gourmet", which presents the beauty of an aristocratic woman in the classical period. Decorated with
                lace, headpieces,
                crushed edges, and large bows, and complemented by the model's exquisite makeup, the look embellishes
                Suzuki's work with
                large prints at the hemline, interpreting the noble woman's unique temperament of elegance and splendor.
                They fulfilled
                all the public's imagination of beauty in that era and became the symbol of female beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki与日本服装品牌Juliette et Justine推出的Mangeurs de
                beauté《食美者》将她古典、高雅的艺术完美地融入了其洛丽塔服饰中，使之甜美而不失历史意蕴。同时，Suzuki擅长使用的浅色调也为服饰的哥特气质增添了一丝属于女性的轻盈感，营造出沉浸式的愉悦感。这一套服装取材于Suzuki的作品《美食家》（英文：Epicure
                Gourmet），呈现了古典时期贵族女人的美丽。这套造型将Suzuki的作品大面积印刻在裙摆处，用蕾丝、头饰、碎边、和大蝴蝶结等进行点缀，辅以模特精致的妆容，诠释了高贵女子典雅、华丽的独特气质。她们还原了那个时代大众对美的所有想象，举手投足间，她们成为了女性美的象征。

            </p>
            <p>
            <p>In the era when feminism had not yet emerged and men regarded women as subordinates, even women who
                enjoyed all the
                glory and wealth in the court were only the companions of men and did not have the freedom to pursue
                their own careers.
                Although women's beauty was greatly influenced by the oppressive gender culture, their pursuit of
                ultimate beauty could
                also be seen as a practice of freedom and blossoming. Their nobility and elegance are both a product of
                a male-dominated
                world and can be interpreted as an anti-patriarchal, female-centered pursuit.</p>
            <p>
                在女权主义尚未兴起，男性将女性视作附属品的时代，即便是宫廷中享尽荣华富贵的女人也只能是男人的陪衬，没有追求个人事业的自由。尽管女性的美极大程度地受到充满压迫的性别文化影响，然而，她们对极致美丽的追求何尝不是一种向往自由与绽放的实践呢？她们的高贵与优雅既是男性主导的世界的产物，也可以解读为反父权的、以女性为中心的追求。
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki's art of the female body, anatomy, and classical aesthetics captivates brands with a
                predominantly female
                consumer base, and the stories Suzuki about women reveal their charm and infinite possibilities from
                ancient times to
                the present. In addition to Juliette et Justine, Imasa and Suzuki collaborated on the lingerie
                collection "Ode to the
                Body", which presents anatomical bodies and other ways to create sexy, mysterious, and peculiar women's
                clothing,
                celebrating women's beautiful bodies and showing the aesthetic possibilities of fashion that blossom
                when combined with
                Suzuki's dark fabrics. Meanwhile, Suzuki's collaborations with rurumu (Spring/Summer 2021 [Symbiosis]),
                KIDILL
                (Fall/Winter 2021-22 [Desire]), a maiden devil (Fall/Winter 2021 [Hidden Museum]), and pays des fées
                (Fall/Winter 2020
                [AnARTonomy]) all collide to create a variety of fashion sparks about anatomy, the female body, and
                desire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki艺术中关于女性身体、解剖、古典美学的元素深深地吸引了以女性消费者为主的品牌。Suzuki所阐述的关于女性的故事展现了她们从古至今的魅力与无限的可能性。除了Juliette et
                Justine，Imasa与Suzuki合作推出的内衣系列《身体的颂歌》通过呈现解剖体等方式打造了了性感、神秘、而奇特的女性衣物，歌颂了女人美妙的身体，展现了她们与带有Suzuki暗黑元素的布料结合所绽放的时尚美学可能性。同时，Suzuki与rurumu（春夏2021
                [共生]），KIDILL（秋冬2021-22 [欲望]），a maiden devil（秋冬2021 [隐藏的博物馆]），以及pays des fées（秋冬2020
                [AnARTonomy]）等的合作皆碰撞出了多样的关于解剖、女体、欲望的时尚火花。
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki's work, with its metaphors of historical anatomical spectacle and East-West aesthetics, and its
                response to
                contemporary feminism, is a fashion art with cultural depth. Because of this, her art has a healing
                effect. It is also
                the reason why several fashion brands have collaborated with Suzuki to create unique, feminine products.
                Her art
                combines intriguingly beautiful and somber elements, creating a strange visual effect that attracts the
                public's
                attention and allows more people to listen attentively to Suzuki's articulation of women and the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzuki作品中关于历史解剖奇观与东西美学的隐喻以及对当代女权主义的回应使之成为有厚重感的时尚艺术。正因为此，其艺术具有疗愈的作用。也因为此，多个时尚品牌与Suzuki合作推出独特的、属于女性的产品。她的艺术结合了让人心生好奇的绮丽、阴郁的元素，形成奇特的视觉效果，吸引大众的视线，让更多人可以用心倾听Suzuki对女性，对世界的阐述。

                Father used to trade original lily-white porcelain with the Bulgarians. Sharp-edged, sleek porcelain
                when smashed into
                pieces. How on earth he managed to do business with those people with his clumsy English did not concern
                me as much as
                the porcelain itself. Sharp-edged, yet sleek, porcelain.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a savvy-business fund manager who, like any sober man, regarded the porcelain as nothing more than
                a trade
                product. That was what I thought until I had this quaint dream back a few years ago. I was, for some
                reason, alone in a
                sultry, buggy (all the chirping and squeaking), and bushy forest, surrounded by the Brisbane heat (why
                it was Brisbane,
                I had no idea). Out of nowhere, I noticed an apparition lying on the surface covered by dry branches and
                fallen leaves.
                It was a pure-white porcelain bowl, intact and uncontaminated, utterly incongruous with the ambiance.
                Then everything
                went motionless, the insects stopped cheeping and the breeze no longer rustled the leaves. The next
                thing I knew, my
                tears were soaking my pillowcase. I never figured out the dream thence, but an intimate connection
                between me and the
                porcelain seemed to have revealed itself.
            </p>

                There had to be an underlying cause, some cause, that triggered all my manic tears over the past few
                months. Was it the
                unlikely dreamy peace among the unsettled mess? Or the monotonous heart badly yearning for fluctuant,
                dramatizing
                emotions? Only partially. It all boiled down to the trade route of the porcelain, which had been cut off
                on account of a
                string of unpredictable events. So the porcelain was packed in transport cases stacked in the warehouse,
                isolating from
                the natural lighting that was supposed to shine through shop windows, where they belonged.

                Halfway to the ‘destination’ shrouded by thick fog, I seemed to have compromised to what would befall
                me, whether or not
                it is a conditional offer. I remembered how the myth of the result accompanied by anxiety and edginess
                haunted me. I
                gripped tightly to the outcome, as if all my social values were dictated by the sheer
                ‘congratulations!’, and wept over
                trivial things like a flash of unfriendliness or acerb retorts of his. Then it struck, proclaiming that
                I wasn't
                suitable for politics, which I instinctively knew. Not attaining full acceptance from all the schools I
                applied for had
                involuntarily undermined my conviction of reaching a specific end and propelled me to loosen my grip on
                the desires, or
                at least I thought it did. The setback (and possibly the subsequent setbacks) was, in nature, a denial
                of the
                unrealistic ego I had built to guard my tattered pride, which was as sharp and fragile as thin porcelain
                chips.

                One should either endure an uncertain, futile and costly high school life or an apparently torturing,
                conflicting one. I
                chose the latter, which turned out just fine, despite all its agonizing and absurd nature. Unanimous
                effort, equally
                dull. I wouldn't have seen so many peculiar phenomena had I taken the other path. Tears, bliss,
                loathing,
                hatred...sentiments that spurt up beyond my expectation had drowned me more often than not. I had
                pondered turning to a
                psychologist whose research focused on toxic perfectionism when I was at my tough valleys, defeated by
                League Tables,
                and preyed to insecurities. And I had struggled to come to terms with the fact that not a few people
                support the mass
                slaughter, as if it were a trivial game that enriched daily chats, citing that it was ideologically and
                geopolitically
                righteous, and was heart-broken to discover how our basic morality had sunk into the mire of toxic
                ideologies and
                dehumanizing big words. I repeatedly hinted that I did not genuinely care about a war that was not even
                remotely
                relevant to my personal interests, for I had been vigilant not to be fooled by ‘kitsch.’ Affecting
                solicitude was a
                disgusting form of the often-times elitist posture.

                I would judge people based on prejudice and instinct and exaggerate the traits that I found unpleasant.
                Perhaps I had a
                twisted perception of what true beautiful humanistic qualities were since I rarely saw any. I should’ve
                been sentenced
                to imprisonment if antagonism were a crime. Those people seldom fussed about the subtle ups and downs,
                assuming they
                were privy trifles (indeed they were) and were nonchalant about their weaponized and offensive language.
                They put hard
                work on the pedestal and excessively took their current success for granted. I admit that I craved for
                honor, yet I
                disdain the unreal ‘me’ basked in vanity and anyone who innocently claimed that honor was minor in
                establishing their
                identity while pride was emanating from their manners. They cherished leisure, leisure enclosed by
                guilt. Yet given a
                choice, they would still opt for a so-called correct and dryly-bustling-around-for-no-reason way of life
                rather than an
                adventuring one, despite all their glamorous fantasies. Seize the moment and its most straightforward
                joy, you might
                argue. Yes, probably.

                The other day, I, for the umpteenth time, cried about some petty things and got confused myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why the tears?” so I asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s self-esteem,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which is why he couldn’t be irritated with or mad at me.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Miserable,” he added.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I laughed, “I love it that you are miserable in this way.”
            </p>
            <p>
                A non-Beauvoir-style view of love. Absolutely exclusive, soul and flesh. I should’ve been more
                self-serving, at least
                not the type of tight-fisted girlfriend who would tentatively observe whoever he was conversing with.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hilarious.”

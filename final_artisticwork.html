                painting
                techniques. I could not draw detailed human faces or static objects since my hands are clumsy. The rose
                on a
                red-white background is one of the few pictures that I created.
                The graffiti is basically a montage of magazine clips. I chose those that I found aesthetically
                attracting,
                with no intention of meaning in mind when organizing the paper. But it turned out fabulous, the meaning,
